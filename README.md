## OVERVIEW
*Sabi nga nila, mahirap magkapamilya at magka-anak.*  
While starting a family is often seen as a source of joy and stability, the reality in the Philippines is far more complicated. This ideal is burdened with pressure: financial, emotional, and social.
Declining marriage and birth rates reflect a growing hesitation among Filipinos to commit to long-term family life, while crime continues to challenge communities across the country. Although many factors shape crime, its patterns may mirror broader societal stress â€” and when regarded alongside trends in birth and marriage, they could reveal meaningful relationships.
Thus, our group chose to explore the correlation between crime, birth, and marriage rates in the Philippines. Without assuming any causation, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that could shed light on the realities of Filipino family life and public safety.
Can we better understand these pressures by investigating how these rates rise and fall together?  
## BACKGROUND
Marriage rates in the Philippines have steadily declined over the past five years, falling by 7.8% from 2022 to 2023 alone. [1] The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a major blow to these rates, bringing 2020 figures to their lowest level since 1970. [2] At the same time, birth rates have continued a gradual year-on-year decline of about 1% since 2021. [3] These trends signal more profound shifts in how Filipinos approach family life, shaped by worsening economic conditions. By the end of 2024, 63% of Filipino families considered themselves poor, with half stating they could not afford a healthy diet. [4] In these conditions, starting a family becomes not just a personal goal but a difficult economic gamble. In parallel, crime rates continue to fluctuate, influenced by both real-world changes and modifications in reporting systems. While efforts in crime prevention and shifts in data collection have affected the numbers, [5] [6] its trends regardless reflect the pressures that communities face.  
Together, these indicators paint a picture of a country grappling with both personal and collective burdens.  
## PROBLEM
Crime, birth, and marriage are often studied separately, yet they are all tied to the state of a society.   
Without a clear grasp of how these trends may interact, we risk overlooking possible indicators of wider societal stress, especially in relation to the demands of building a family.  
## SOLUTION
We endeavor to leverage the power of data science to analyze statistics surrounding crimes, births, and marriages. By dissecting monthly and regional data from 2022 to the most recent available data, we hope to surface correlations that can spark deeper conversations about social strain and the lived realities of Filipinos today.  
## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Is there a statistically significant correlation between crime rates and birth and marriage rates in the Philippines?  
What patterns in crime rates emerge across Philippine regions with varying birth and marriage rates?  
How do these patterns differ between urban and rural areas?  
Which combinations of birth and marriage rates show the strongest association with specific types of crime?
## NULL HYPOTHESIS
There is no statistically significant correlation between crime rates and birth and marriage rates in the Philippines.
## ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS
There is a statistically significant correlation between crime rates and birth and marriage rates in the Philippines.
## ACTION PLAN
We collect monthly crime data by type and region, along with birth and marriage data by region, to explore trends and assess correlations between crime rates and both birth and marriage rates.
